# Kubernetes Advanced Topics Lab (Next Lab)

## Overview:
In the next lab, we will build on our knowledge and focus on more advanced Kubernetes topics such as:

- **Working with Deployments, ReplicaSets, and Pods:**
  - Understand how Kubernetes ensures desired states and scales Pods based on ReplicaSets.
  - Learn how to handle scaling Pods and managing Pod health.

- **Creating and Managing Services:**
  - Learn about **Services** to expose Pods to other resources or outside the cluster.
  - Explore different types of Services like ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.

- **Pod Health and Readiness Probes:**
  - Understand how to configure **liveness** and **readiness probes** to check if Pods are healthy and ready to serve traffic.

- **Namespaces:**
  - Learn about **Namespaces** to organize resources and isolate workloads in Kubernetes.

- **Using Helm:**
  - Introduction to **Helm**, the Kubernetes package manager. Learn how to use Helm charts to deploy and manage applications more efficiently.

## Goals for Lab 2:
1. Deploy a set of Pods using Deployments and scale them.
2. Expose Pods using Services (ClusterIP, NodePort).
3. Set up liveness and readiness probes for Pods.
4. Work with Kubernetes Namespaces to organize resources.
5. Use Helm to install an application package.

## Next Steps:
1. Set up the cluster with multiple Pods and practice scaling.
2. Explore how Kubernetes handles high-availability and self-healing mechanisms.
3. Get hands-on with Helm to deploy apps in Kubernetes.
