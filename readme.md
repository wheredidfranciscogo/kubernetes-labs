# Lab 1: Deploying a Simple Web Application on Kubernetes

## Objective
This lab demonstrates how to deploy a simple web application (Nginx) on Kubernetes using Minikube.

## Steps
1. Create a Deployment that runs two replicas of an Nginx container.
2. Expose the app using a LoadBalancer type service.
3. Access the app through Minikube's service command.

## Notes
- Use Minikube with Docker driver to simulate Kubernetes locally.
- Explore scaling the app by changing replica count.
