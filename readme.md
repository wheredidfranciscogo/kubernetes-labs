## Future Labs
In future labs, we will dive deeper into advanced Kubernetes topics, including integrations with cloud providers, serverless workloads, advanced monitoring techniques, and using Kubernetes in multi-cluster environments.

---

## How to Run the Labs:
1. Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster set up (either locally using Minikube, Docker Desktop, or in the cloud).
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions for each lab.
3. Use `kubectl` and k9s for interacting with your cluster, along with any other necessary tools specified for each lab.
4. Check out the README for each lab for specific setup and instructions.

---

## Tools You Will Use:
- **kubectl**: Kubernetes command-line tool for cluster management.
- **k9s**: Terminal UI tool for Kubernetes, offering an intuitive way to navigate and manage resources.
- **Helm**: Kubernetes package manager for deploying applications using Helm charts.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Tools for cluster monitoring and alerting.
- **Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK)**: Tools for managing logs and troubleshooting.
- **Minikube**: Tool for running Kubernetes clusters locally.
- **Docker Desktop**: Tool for running Docker containers and Kubernetes clusters on macOS and Windows.
